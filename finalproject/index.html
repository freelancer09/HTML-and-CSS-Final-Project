                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end user while being delivered by a provider over the Internet. 
                The verb to stream refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in a continuous manner from a particular source. Streaming refers to the 
                delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to 
                telecommunications networks, as most of the traditional media delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. radio, television) or inherently
                non-streaming (e.g. books, videotape, audio CDs). There are challenges with streaming content on the Internet. For example, users whose Internet 
                connection lacks sufficient bandwidth may experience stops, lags, or slow buffering of the content. And users lacking compatible hardware or 
                software systems may be unable to stream certain content. With the use of buffering content just a few seconds in advance, the quality can get much better.
                <br><br>

                Livestreaming is the delivery of Internet content in real-time much as live television broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal. 
                Livestreaming requires a form of source media (e.g. a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder to digitize the content, a 
                media publisher, and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content. Livestreaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point, 
                although it frequently is.
                <br><br>

                Streaming is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to 
                it. Through streaming, an end-user can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before the entire file has been 
                transmitted. The term "streaming media" can apply to media other than video and audio, such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, 
                which are all considered "streaming text".
                <br><br>

                Nowadays streaming is most prevalent in many video on demand and streaming television services. Some popular streaming services include Netflix, 
                Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Paramount+, Peacock, Prime Video, YouTube, and other sites which stream films and television shows; Apple Music, YouTube Music 
                and Spotify, which stream music; and video game live streaming services such as Twitch.

                <h2>What factors slow down streaming?</h2>
                <h3>On the network side:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Network latency: A variety of factors impact latency, including where the content that users are trying to access is stored.</li>
                    <li>Network congestion: If too much data is sent through the network, this can degrade streaming performance.</li>
                </ul>                

                <h3>On the user side:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>WiFi problems: Restarting the LAN router, or switching to Ethernet instead of WiFi, can help improve streaming performance.</li>
                    <li>Slowly performing client devices: To play videos takes a good amount of processing power. If the device streaming the video has a 
                        lot of other processes running or is just slow in general, streaming performance can be impacted.</li>
                    <li>Not enough bandwidth: For streaming video, home networks need about 4 Mbps of bandwidth; for high-definition video, they will likely need more.</li>
                </ul>
